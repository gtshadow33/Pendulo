Pendulum Simulation

A simple pendulum simulation written in Rust using the ggez game engine. This project demonstrates basic physics, animation, and user input handling in real-time.

Features

Simulates a pendulum with realistic physics

Adjustable pendulum length and angle

Real-time animation

Basic user interaction: increase/decrease angle, start, pause

Controls

Enter: Start the pendulum

+ (plus key): Increase the pendulum angle

- (minus key): Decrease the pendulum angle

Escape: Close the application
